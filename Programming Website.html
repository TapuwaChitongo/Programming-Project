        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <h2> Some words about ME</h2>

        <p>My name is Tapuwa Chitongo, a 20-year old Entreprenuer currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. As a self-described social butterfly, I find it easy to interact with people and
speak to crowds confidently.<br>I am fairly good at coordinating different ideas into an event that captures the mood, message and
individualistic style of my natural creative nature.<br>With a flexible, adaptable get it done attitude, I welcome any challenges that
may inevitably arise. I am not one to shy from a problem, I seek out creative solutions that many others overlook and deem as
impossible to overcome.<br>Through leadership experience I have attained skills in servant leadership as well as the ability to
facilitate and work with a team.</p>
